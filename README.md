Hey, this is my "first" official script.

idle resmon is 0.00 -- it can be up in high, but mainly because of the garage part, but if you can help to reduce the usage, than i will be thankfull.

Depencies :

ESX

MySql Async

Ox Inventory

ESX Menu Default (mine is different cause I use a reworked version)

Usage: 

Upload the sql,
Make sure you setup the Config for your Usage purpose!
And start the script

Disclaimer!

It's for education reason only! And if you change the name of the folder, make sure you changing it in the JS part too, otherwise it will be not working..
