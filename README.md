Hey, this is my "first" official script.

idle resmon is 0.00 -- it can be up in high, but mainly because of the garage part, but if you can help to reduce the usage, than i will be thankfull.

Depencies :

ESX

MySql Async

Usage: 

Upload the sql,
Make sure that you added you group to the config!
And start the script

Disclaimer!

It's for education reason only! And if you change the name of the folder, make sure you changing it in the JS part too, otherwise it will be not working..
